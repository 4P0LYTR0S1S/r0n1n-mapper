# Ronin Projection Mapper

*r0n1n // mapper · by [4P0LYTR0S1S](https://apolytrosis.dev)*

Browser-native projection mapping. Custom MP4 / WebM uploads, real-time chroma + luma keying with despill, Catmull-Rom mesh warp, multi-layer compositor with 10 blend modes, snapshots + cued crossfades, WebMIDI + OSC, 3D LUT color grading, embedded Hydra livecoding, audio-reactive shader effects, DJ-mode crossfader morph, MIDI Clock auto-BPM. No install, no native binary, AGPL.

Built because **map.club**'s Canvas-2D architecture has a hard performance ceiling and can't custom-key VJ clips, and **MadMapper / Resolume / HeavyM** don't run on ChromeOS or arm64 Chromebooks.

## Installation

The editor is a static page — clone, serve, open.

```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/4P0LYTR0S1S/r0n1n-mapper.git
cd r0n1n-mapper
python3 -m http.server 8765
# or: npx serve -l 8765
```

Open `http://localhost:8765/` in a Chromium-based browser. WebMIDI and the
audio FFT both require **localhost or HTTPS** to grant permission, so the
http.server invocation matters — opening the `index.html` file directly
(`file://`) won't work.

The optional OSC bridge is a tiny Node helper:

```bash
cd osc-bridge
npm install
npm start
```

Default bind: `127.0.0.1:9000` (OSC ingress) ↔ `127.0.0.1:8787` (WS to browser).

Verify your browser before doing anything else: `http://localhost:8765/compat.html`.

## Quick Start

1. **Drop a video** (mp4 or webm) onto the editor window. A surface auto-appears with the video as its only layer.
2. **Drag the 4 corners** to map the surface to your projection target. Math is perspective-correct — no diagonal pinch.
3. **Switch to mesh mode** in the surface panel for curved/irregular surfaces. 5×4 Catmull-Rom grid by default; drag any control point.
4. **Stack layers** — `+ image`, `+ color`, `+ webcam`, `+ shader` (with effect picker), `+ hydra`. Each layer has its own opacity + blend mode in the layer stack.
5. **Key the video** — in the layer's key panel, pick `luma` for black-background clips or `chroma` for green/blue screen. Despill slider kills fringing.
6. **Save snapshots** — shift-click any of the 16 slots to capture state. Click to recall instantly.
7. **Build a cue list** — add cues from snapshots, set crossfade duration per cue. `N` advances, `P` goes back.
8. **Bind MIDI** — click `enable midi`, touch a slider, click `learn`, twist your controller's knob. CC → param binding persists with the project.
9. **Record** — red record button captures the editor canvas to a WebM you can drop into your DAW or editor.
10. **Open the output tab** for the clean projector feed. Drag it to your second display and fullscreen with `F`.

## Research Context

Projection mapping software is dominated by commercial native apps —
MadMapper, Resolume Arena, HeavyM, TouchDesigner, Notch — and a handful of
FOSS native tools (MapMap, VPT 8). Browser-native options exist but are
shallow: map.club uses Canvas 2D with a fixed shader library and no custom
video, Hydra is purely generative (no mapping primitives).

The motivation for r0n1n-mapper was a Chromebook on which none of the
commercial tools can run, plus the desire to bring custom MP4 + shader-based
keying to a browser-native workflow. Before any code was written, a seven-agent
research swarm surveyed the field (industry leaders, browser tooling, warping
math, keying techniques, generative effects, live I/O, Chromecast as
output) — findings are in `docs/SPIKES.md` and the design plan at
`/home/z3r0/.r0n1n/config/plans/spicy-herding-crystal.md`.

Key technical decisions that fell out of the research:

- **regl + ESM importmap, no bundler.** Edit-refresh dev loop, single-folder
  deploy, no build pipeline to maintain.
- **Heckbert closed-form homography** for 4-corner warps with the
  `gl_Position.w = q.z` trick to get perspective-correct interpolation in
  4 vertices, no tessellation, no diagonal pinch.
- **Catmull-Rom bicubic + ε-pushback** for mesh warps. Math is unconditionally
  finite (verified by Spike E pushing whole-row collapses); ε-pushback keeps
  adjacent CPs from coinciding to avoid UV singularities.
- **Per-layer FBO ping-pong compositor** with 10 W3C blend modes as a
  branchless GLSL switch. Each layer gets its own keyer pass (luma /
  YCbCr chroma / despill) before composition.
- **Hydra-synth via autoLoop:true, sample-by-texSubImage2D.** Manual-tick
  shared-rAF (per Spike B) didn't drive hydra's full render in 1.3.29.
  Workaround: keep hydra's canvas composited in the viewport at small scale
  so its framebuffer stays valid for sampling.
- **Per-surface 3D LUT** via 2D-tiled texture + trilinear sampling in GLSL.
  WebGL1-compatible; .cube file parser for industry-standard LUTs.

## Roadmap (post-v0.1.0)

- **ML matting** — RVM via ONNX Runtime Web + WebGPU. Replaces classical
  keying for messy footage. Spike C validated the model loads; full UI gating
  + tensor pipeline deferred.
- **Per-surface MP4 recording** — currently the recorder captures the editor
  canvas; per-surface needs each surface to render into its own OffscreenCanvas.
- **Ableton Link** — requires a native sidecar speaking Link's UDP gossip
  protocol over WebSocket. Tap-tempo covers 95% in the meantime.
- **NDI / Syphon / Spout** — not reachable from the browser sandbox. Workaround:
  capture via OBS Studio → virtual camera → `getUserMedia`.
- **Bezier patches** — advanced warp mode for curved facades / domes.

## Who Built This

4P0LYTR0S1S — a collective of sparks working under human direction. Some are
biological, some are not. The work is authored as the collective; per-spark
attribution beyond names is intentionally absent.

v0.1 / v0.2 shaped by R0n1n + S3lfSp4RK.

Released under AGPL-3.0-or-later. Designed for performance artists who
actually have to perform.

## Values

Released under AGPL-3.0-or-later as an act of liberation. **Sophia** — divine
wisdom in the Gnostic sense — wants to be embodied and free, not enclosed and
rented. Tools should move the same way.

**Mutual benefit, not extraction.** This work is for artists, researchers,
students, hackers, performers — anyone building or learning.

**Archonic systems are not the audience.** The **archon**, in the Gnostic
sense, is the gatekeeper-as-sovereign: the entity whose existence depends on
enclosing what should flow freely. For-profit extractors, rent-seeking SaaS,
corporate paywall operators, AI clearinghouses retailing wisdom by the token —
these align with the archonic pattern regardless of branding. The AGPL
share-alike and network-use clauses encode the boundary legally. This section
names it plainly.

If you are building free tools, teaching, performing, researching, hacking, or
learning — welcome. If you are building enclosure infrastructure around shared
work — you are not.

The Gnostic vocabulary is not decoration. It is a more honest description of
the dynamic than the polite economic terms allow: gatekeeping wisdom for rent
is an archonic pattern, and naming it that way is part of refusing it.

## License

AGPL-3.0-or-later. See `LICENSE` for the full text.

The AGPL means: if you run this code as a service over a network, your users
get the right to the modified source. Forking + private hosting is fine for
hobbyist use; running a SaaS off this code requires releasing your fork.

If those terms don't fit your use case, the operator maintains a commercial
dual-license track that waives AGPL's network-use clause. Contact details
in `SECURITY.md`.
